# APS Fault Detection Using Artificial Neural Networks

This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to detect faults in the APS (Application Programming Standard) dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, with preprocessing steps involving data cleaning, encoding, and scaling.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the APS Fault Detection dataset, which can be found at APS Data.
Data Description
The dataset contains various features related to the APS and indicates whether a fault has occurred.
The target variable is named class, which indicates the presence or absence of faults.
